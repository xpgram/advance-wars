# Advance Wars

A clone of "Days of Ruin" (2008) written in Typescript with Pixi.js, and a sound API when I get around to it.  
You can play the current public build [here.](https://xpgram.github.io/armed-revolt/game.html)

Progress is slow only because I have responsibilities and I feel guilty working on this instead.

Currently features:
 - Random map generation.
 - Map tiles which auto-configure their sprites to match their surroundings. Seemless, beautiful. *\*chefskiss\**
 - Authentic cursor controls. (whoopee)
 - A turn engine which makes turn-state scripting simple. I just flip UI switches: this is on, that isn't on. So easy.
 - Pathfinding for unit travel, and unit travel animation.
 - A working camera. It zooms!
 - Basic play: Inter-unit attacking, but not among allies; an unfinished command menu with contextual actions.
 - Complete (or near complete, I forget) unit and terrain properties, assembled into discrete class-types via python code generation.
 - A scene-pattern style architecture I have yet to take advantage of. But see, I plan for the future. That's why I'm a special boy.
 - Efficient sprite-draw managementâ€”I'm working on this, actually. Nearly there.
