- [x] Python script â†’ generated Javascript code (Terrain Tiles)
  - [x] Finish JS code template
- [ ] Add static get landTile() back into Terrain.Tile template (it was convenient)
- [x] Standardize Terrain tileset picker
  sea-cliff and sea-shallow are fairly simple now, move them into reusable methods.
- [ ] Figure out how to differentiate between bridge-sea and bridge-river
  - [x] Do that
  - [ ] But then, like, test it out
- [x] Standardize the sea tile: it always comes with 3 layers (sea, shallow, cliff) and is used as a base for enough tiles that writing this repeatedly should upset me.
- [ ] Use import 'pixi.js';
  - [x] Install pixi using npm (strictly necessary?)
  - [ ] Add imports to every script that needs them
  - [ ] Remove <script src="pixi"> from game.html
- [x] Camera System: Moves stage around.
  - [x] Camera Zoom: Applies additional scale factor to stage. Stage will need to add it to its fit-to-window scale.
