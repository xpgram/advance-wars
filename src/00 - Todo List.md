- [ ] Re-rip the plasma textures: some of them are clipped by 1px.
- [ ] Sea looks nicer, I think, but my frame-animation skills are a teense lacking. Update it.
- [ ] Debug information (FPS, etc.) needs to go into a debug class that populates a debug visual layer.
  - [ ] Game.init()'s process should look like this:
    - [x] Setup Pixi app
    - [ ] pre(): Load universally useful resources and save them as Game.resources
    - [ ] On completion, do some post setup (new DebugLayer()), assign the first scene and start the game loop.
- [ ] Refactor unit sprites
    - [ ] (On a different sheet) All have an 'exhibit' image matching the dimensions of landscape images for terrain.

 - [ ] UI Window Update
    - [ ] One 24 px, 1 px gap, one 8 px
    - [ ] The 'main' window switches with the x-button to either unit or terrain, just like Detail.
    - [ ] To transition, there is a 2â€“3 frame wipe effect
        - [ ] First wipe: 8 px bar moves down, maintaining 1px gaps above and below it, revealing the other window.
            - [ ] For terrains with visual spillover, spillover is masked away *only* as the transition is happening.
        - [ ] Second wipe (concurrent): A 1px gap moves across the 8px bar horizontally, revealing the essential details of whichever subject isn't being focused on.
    - [ ] The switching variation of this window set only exists when both terrain and unit need to be displayed. Otherwise, we default to the normal 24px terrain window.
        - [ ] If units are the focused subject: moving between an empty tile and an occupied one should instantly (no anim) shrink the terrain window to 8px and display the unit window above it.
        - [ ] If terrain is the focused subject: the 8px bar showing unit essential details should pop in.
