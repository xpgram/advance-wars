- [ ] Re-rip the plasma textures: some of them are clipped by 1px.
- [ ] Sea looks nicer, I think, but my frame-animation skills are a teense lacking. Update it.
- [ ] UI Icons: Missing Wrench cursor icon that appears when hovering over factories.
- [ ] Debug information (FPS, etc.) needs to go into a debug class that populates a debug visual layer.
  - [ ] Game.init()'s process should look like this:
    - [x] Setup Pixi app
    - [ ] pre(): Load universally useful resources and save them as Game.resources
    - [ ] On completion, do some post setup (new DebugLayer()), assign the first scene and start the game loop.
