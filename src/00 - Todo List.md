- [x] Migrate Map
  - [x] Rewrite It: Although it should technically be fine, it's still *Javascript* code, so update its style and form to TypeScript (documentation is *mostly* what I'm referring to).
- [x] Migrate BattleScene
- [x] Post Migration: Test, Tweak and Re-Test until it actually works.
  - [x] Add pixi.js imports ... everywhere.

- [x] Figure out how to differentiate between bridge-sea and bridge-river
  - [x] Do that
  - [x] But then, like, test it out.
