- [x] Migrate Terrain
- [x] Migrate Map
  - [x] Rewrite It: Although it should technically be fine, it's still *Javascript* code, so update its style and form to TypeScript (documentation is *mostly* what I'm referring to).
- [ ] Migrate BattleScene
- [ ] Post Migration: Test, Tweak and Re-Test until it actually works.
  - [ ] Add pixi.js imports ... everywhere.
    - [ ] For that matter, figure out why VSCode doesn't let me know I haven't. Why does it pretend to know what PIXI.anything is? Oh, the docs, maybe...
- [ ] Figure out how to differentiate between bridge-sea and bridge-river
  - [x] Do that
  - [ ] But then, like, test it out.
