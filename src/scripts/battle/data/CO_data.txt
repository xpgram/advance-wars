Lin, I think, should be able to see cloaked units too.
This only means subs.
...
I mean, it's something.
What if Lin also invoked Fog of War for a turn or two?
She's 'balanced', so I don't want to mess with her too much, but I changed Forsythe to 2-2 which I realize makes him a waaay better version of her.
Maybe I just need to tweak him differently.

Forsythe.
Okay.
Maybe the best thing I can do for him is give him a CO Power.
"What" is a great question...
He is similar to Kanbei, sorta.
He's also Mr. Honorable.
He should play into those traits.
I thought about letting him counter-attack at full HP (or starting HP) like in SNES days. Reminds me of honorable warfare, taking turns to volley, etc. Kinda silly, though.
His problem ~right now~ isn't that his 5-radius CO Zone isn't ~good~, it's that it isn't ~great~. And he has no tide-turning CO Power either.
So, although he seems to cast a wide net, he ends up sort of middling.
Here's ~an~ idea:
    5-radius still
    New CO Power (this means his radius extends to 7)
    "Counter Break" (Sonja's)   He reduces enemy terrain bonuses by 1 or 2 stars.
The only thing I don't like about this is that it "messes with too much."
Most abilities in this game refrain from getting too whacky, and are limited to things like
improving the mobility of your own units.
If Forsythe is a tactical maven, maybe his CO Power allows him to attack without enemy terrain bonuses applying.
I do kind of like that he doesn't have a power though. If I take that away from him, Caulder will be the only one left.

Greyfield's COP is boring. He has high defense, though.
As far as tips, I'm only getting that "Sea isn't part of the metagame," so I don't know what to tweak.

Penny's weather effect is cool. She's like Olaf.
What really cripples her is the lack of damage or defense boosts.
Maybe, the random weather she gets, maybe she should feel the inverse effects?  Like +30% instead of -30% like everyone else. This widens the gap, anyway.

Caulder, holy shit—if I reduce his boosts and limit his COZ repair to 1 HP per turn, he ~might~ be okay.
I limited his CO Zone to 2 before, but until playtesting I'm not even sure I need to do that.
You know, if he's a walking city, does he even need a damage boost?
Playtest!
