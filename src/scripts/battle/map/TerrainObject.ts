/** TODO Implement Efficient Tile Overlays
 * Constructor: build static filters if they do not exist.
 * Constructor: assign single or double-sized filter depending on terrain properties.
 * Constructor: Register uniform update callback to Game ticker if not previously done.
 * Rename whitemask sprite to overlay.
 * Uniform Update Method:
 *   If TextureLibrary does not have a texture:
 *     Render current view to texture.                            \
 *     Build sprite from texture.                                 | Could apply filters directly to current view, render to
 *     Apply [whitemask, tileOverlay] filters to built sprite.    / texture, then unapply.
 *     Render built sprite to new texture.
 *     Register new texture with TextureLibrary.
 *     Assign new texture to overlay sprite object.
 *   Else
 *     Get texture from TextureLibrary.
 *     Assign texture to overlay sprite object.
 *
 * TextureLibraryID format:
 *   '[name]:[orientation]:[tint]' => PIXI.Texture
 *   Could we render a grayscale overlay and tint the resulting texture?
 *   Pixi tints are nearly costless. They might also be within the shader, though.
