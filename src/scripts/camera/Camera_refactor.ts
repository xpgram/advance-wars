//  1- ideal: The ideal camera coordinates and settings: where cam *should* be.

//  2- (last): The real camera ... from last frame; private.
//  3- vector: The difference between this and last frame's actual transform.
//  4- offset: Camera coordinates and settings relative to actual; for screen shake.
//  5- (render): actual + offset, used for next draw(); private.
// Movement patterns:
//  1- Position alg: Sets a state for the camera to aim to transition to.
//  2- Approach alg: Sets a method of actual to ideal state travel.
//  3- Relative alg: Sets a method of motion relative to its cur (screen shake).

// FollowAlgorithms will need to take a ViewRect and a focal point|undefined as inputs
// instead. This is probably more Functional anyway.
