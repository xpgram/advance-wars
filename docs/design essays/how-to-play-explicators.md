# What do...?

I need to collect a bunch of assets which explain what this game is and how to do literally anything. Some of these assets might actually make it into the game itself.

Q: How get Pixi save texture [x] and then download that to your PC [ ]?
I suppose it doesn't matter, like, *too* much, maybe; but I want to get the resolution right.

Aspect Ratio: 5:3
Resolution: 320x192


## Feature-set

I'm gonna start by cataloguing all the things I've added that I might include.

All of these will be accompanied by a little gif-video clip.




## Intro [I'm working on it]

The primary drive is to... well. Honestly, it's all the fun I have. But the *second* primary drive—the *bi*mary drive, if you will—is to show off to employers. I am very cool, after all.

If you happen to be an employer.

Uh.

I dunno, I'm hard to reach sometimes.

I like working on games. I can work on other things.  
—Let's just get on with the presentation.

## Features

There are quite many, so I'll break them up here.

Contextual actions

Troop-inside-troop recursion

### VFX

Shaders..?
I don't have the burn-away yet. But I'll know where to put it.

[show...?]

Click?
[minimap already shows this]

Dev tools
